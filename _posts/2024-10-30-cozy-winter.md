# Ode to Autumn

In autumn's gentle, golden light,
The world prepares for winter's night.
Leaves of amber, crimson, gold,
Whisper stories softly told.

A cozy winter soon will start,
With warmth that fills each loving heart.
Blankets, cocoa, fireside cheer,
As frosty nights draw ever near.

Embrace the season's quiet grace,
In autumn's glow, find your place.
For every leaf that falls, a sign,
Of cozy wintertime, divine.
